# Material Icons - Touch Portal Icon Pack

I was looking for nice icon packs for my Touch Portal setup, but none of the designs had a good fit for me.</br>
So, I did some work to create my own based on the Material Icons set. ðŸ˜‰

**See https://fonts.google.com/icons for the full icon list.**

The pack exists of both black and white 96x96 icons of all Material Icons. (of the 2.0 spec)<br />
I've splitted the icons per category in separate files. In TouchPortal they are present in alphabetical order.<br />
This makes it easier to filter through them when looking for specific ones.<br />
<br />

## How to install

The same as any generic Icon Pack there is out there:
1. Clone the repository or individually download the `.tpi` files.
2. Import the files one by one in TouchPortal using `Gear/Settings icon -> Import Icon Pack...`
<br />

## FAQ

### - Are all Material Icons present in this pack?
Almost, I'm busy updating the pack with all categories ðŸ˜„

### - But, the list of Icons is HUGE! What's up with the file size?
I only included both a <ins>white</ins> and <ins>black</ins> variant of each icon, as a 96x96 PNG file.<br />
They are separated in categories, so you could only import one of them if you'd like.<br />
However, the largest category, `Action`, is around 2,7 MB unzipped. So there is nothing to worry about ðŸ˜†
